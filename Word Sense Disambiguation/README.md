# Word Sense Disambiguation
A sample code for Word-Sense Disambiguation. 
The algorithm used herein is the Lesk algorithm, which is based on the premise that words in a given sentence(s) are related to each other, and that this relation manifests in the very definition of those words and/or their senses. The property being looked for is an overlap of words between the word to be disambiguated and the neighboring words (and their definition, and senses).

The algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB, and is part of the Braille e-book reader project I had worked on.
